# Advanced Concepts

By now, you should be able to create basic filter elements that can
receive and send data. This is the simple model that GStreamer stands
for. But GStreamer can do much more than only this\! In this chapter,
various advanced topics will be discussed, such as scheduling, special
pad types, clocking, events, interfaces, tagging and more. These topics
are the sugar that makes GStreamer so easy to use for applications.
