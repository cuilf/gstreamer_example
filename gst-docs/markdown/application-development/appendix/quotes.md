# Quotes from the Developers

As well as being a cool piece of software, GStreamer is a lively
project, with developers from around the globe very actively
contributing. We often hang out on the \#gstreamer IRC channel on
irc.freenode.net: the following are a selection of amusing\[1\] quotes
from our conversations.

    When I opened my eyes I was in a court room. There were masters
    McIlroy and Thompson sitting in the jury and master Kernighan too.
    There were the GStreamer developers standing in the defendant's
    place, accused of violating several laws of Unix philosophy and
    customer lock-down via running on a proprietary pipeline, different
    from that of the Unix systems. I heard Eric Raymond whispering "got
    to add this case to my book.

    *\<\_\_tim\>* Uraeus: amusing, isn't it?

    *\<Uraeus\>* \_\_tim: I wrote that :)

    *\<\_\_tim\>* Uraeus: of course you did; your refusal to surrender
    to the oppressive regime of the third-person-singular-rule is so
    unique in its persistence that it's hard to miss :)

    *thomas*: jrb, somehow his screenshotsrc grabs whatever X is showing
    and makes it available as a stream of frames

    *jrb*: thomas: so, is the point that the screenshooter takes a
    video? but won't the dialog be in the video? oh, nevermind. I'll
    just send mail...

    *thomas*: jrb, well, it would shoot first and ask questions later

    *Omega:* did you run ldconfig? maybe it talks to init?

    *wtay:* not sure, don't think so... I did run gstreamer-register
    though :-)

    *Omega:* ah, that did it then ;-)

    *wtay:* right

    *Omega:* probably not, but in case GStreamer starts turning into an
    OS, someone please let me know?

    *wtay:* hehe, forgot "zan"

    *Omega:* that means probably building an agreggating,
    cache-massaging queue to shove N buffers across all at once, forcing
    cache transfer.

    *wtay:* never done that before...

    *Omega:* nope, but it's easy to do in gstreamer \<g\>

    *wtay:* sure, I need to rewrite cp with gstreamer too, someday :-)

    *wtay:* we need to cut down the time to create an mp3 player down to
    seconds...

    *richardb:* :)

    *Omega:* I'm wanting to something more interesting soon, I did the
    "draw an mp3 player in 15sec" back in October '99.

    *wtay:* by the time Omega gets his hands on the editor, you'll see a
    complete audio mixer in the editor :-)

    *richardb:* Well, it clearly has the potential...

    *Omega:* Working on it... ;-)
