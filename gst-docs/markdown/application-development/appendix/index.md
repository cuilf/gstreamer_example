# Appendices

By now, you've learned all about the internals of GStreamer and
application programming using the GStreamer framework. This part will go
into some random bits that are useful to know if you're going to use
GStreamer for serious application programming. It will touch upon things
related to integration with popular desktop environments that we run on
(GNOME, KDE, OS X, Windows), it will shortly explain how applications
included with GStreamer can help making your life easier, and some
information on debugging.

In addition, we also provide a porting guide which will explain easily
how to port GStreamer-0.10 applications to GStreamer-1.0.
