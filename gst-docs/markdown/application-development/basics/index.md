# Building an Application

In these chapters, we will discuss the basic concepts of GStreamer and
the most-used objects, such as elements, pads and buffers. We will use a
visual representation of these objects so that we can visualize the more
complex pipelines you will learn to build later on. You will get a first
glance at the GStreamer API, which should be enough for building
elementary applications. Later on in this part, you will also learn to
build a basic command-line application.

Note that this part will give a look into the low-level API and concepts
of GStreamer. Once you're going to build applications, you might want to
use higher-level APIs. Those will be discussed later on in this manual.
