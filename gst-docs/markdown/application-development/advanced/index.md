# Advanced GStreamer concepts

In this part we will cover the more advanced features of GStreamer. With
the basics you learned in the previous part you should be able to create
a *simple* application. However, GStreamer provides much more candy than
just the basics of playing back audio files. In this chapter, you will
learn more of the low-level features and internals of GStreamer.

Some parts of this part will serve mostly as an explanation of how
GStreamer works internally; they are not actually needed for actual
application development. This includes chapters such as the ones
covering scheduling, autoplugging and synchronization. Other chapters,
however, discuss more advanced ways of pipeline-application interaction,
and can turn out to be very useful for certain applications. This
includes the chapters on metadata, querying and events, interfaces,
dynamic parameters and pipeline data manipulation.
